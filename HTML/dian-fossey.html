    <h2>Life and Work</h2>
    <p>
        Dian Fossey was born in San Francisco, California on January 16, 1932. Throughout her formative years, she developed a passion for animals, which led her to a career as a zoologist, primatologist, and anthropologist. While as a child her primary love was horses, she is best known today for her extensive work both studying and protecting mountain gorillas. For 18 years, Fossey lived and worked in Africa, first in the Congo and later in Rwanda. Her time spent with the gorillas culminated in her best-selling book <i>Gorillas in the Mist</i>, which was later made into a film.

        Along with uncovering new infomation about the behavior of gorillas, Fossey also dedicated much of her life to protecting and conserving them. She founded the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda in close proximity to the gorilla troops that she was studying, in order to both study them and to deter poachers. She and her team not only destroyed poacher's traps, they also captured and aided in the arrest of several poachers who killed and injured gorillas for profit. Fossey also founded the Digit Fund, now known as the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. Named after her favorite gorilla, the fund raises money for the conservation of gorilla populations and protection against poachers.

        Dian Fossey was found murdered in 1985, for yet unknown reasons. Despite the tragedy of her death, Fossey is still making an impact protecting the lives and habitats of mountain gorillas.
